  summary:
    "I began my software development journey a year ago, inspired and supported by incredible mentors who fueled my passion for technology. In June 2023, I was thrilled to receive an invitation from some of the best teachers to qualify for an intensive software development training. Though I'm still pursuing my Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering, I chose to take on the challenge and commit to this path. It’s been the best decision of my life, shaping me into the developer I am today. Now, I’m excited to carry forward this passion, aspiring to make a positive impact and help others along the way",
